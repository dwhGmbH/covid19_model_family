    In literature, effectiveness of an pharmaceutical intervention is typically defined for an observed time span after the event. E.g. vaccine effectiveness 2 to 4 weeks after the vaccination is 0.8, meaning, that compared to a cohort without vaccination, numbers of infections is reduced by 4/5th. We may interpret this result in that way, that the intervention causes that 80% of all vaccinated persons are rendered immune withn the regarded time-period. I.e. the average fraction of immunes is f_data(t)=0.8 for 14<=t<28.
    We may model this behaviour individually by regarding two distinct processes:
    First, there is a chance, that the intervention does not work at all. We regard this as 'base' probability. Second, the immunity is waning with a certain distribution. I.e. if the intervention caused immunity at all, there is a time X, after which the immunity is lost again. We characterize X by a given distribution and a distribution parameter, tapically the 'mean' - i.e. E(X)=mean.
    Goal of this fitting process is to find values 'mean' and 'base' s.t. the resulting distribution causes, on average, 80% immunity 15 to 28 days after the event.
    According to the model, the fraction of persons being immune t days after the immunization event, i.e. the value of the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, computes to f_model(t) = base*(1-F_X(t)), whereas F_X is the cumulative distribution function of X with E(X)=mean. In the fitting process we calculate the relative error between the average effectivenss: \int f_model(t) dt  and \int f_data(t) dt for t in the interval [14,28).
    In the typical case, effectiveness is not only given for one time interval, but for a series of intervals. This causes f_data to be a piecewise constant function.

    The optimization is done using the Nelder-Mead downhill simplex algorithm. The survival curve f_model is estimated using sampling of waning dates and fit of the Kaplan Meier curve via a suitable python package.
